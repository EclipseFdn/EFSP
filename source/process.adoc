= Eclipse Foundation Specification Process v1.1

Version 1.1. Effective March 20, 2019

toc::[]

The document describes the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process (EFSP) for optional use by Eclipse Foundation Working Groups.

The EFSP leverages and augments the https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process.php[Eclipse Development Process] (EDP). The EDP defines important concepts, including the Open Source Rules of Engagement, the organizational framework for open source projects and teams, releases, reviews, and more.

Although many of the activities related to this process are conducted by open source projects operating under the EDP, this specification process, and the Specification Versions delivered under it, are to be managed by Working Groups.

Subject to the approval of the Eclipse Management Organization (Executive Director or Delegate), individual Specification Committees may tailor the process for their unique requirements.

This document, and future revisions thereof will be approved by the Eclipse Foundation Board of Directors.

[[efsp-structure]]
== Structure and Organization

A Specification Project is the main operational unit for Specification development at the Eclipse Foundation.

[[efsp-projects]]
=== Specification Projects

Specification Projects operate under the supervision of both the Project Leadership Chain and the Specification Committee.

Among other things, the Scope of a Specification Project is intended to inform companies and individuals so they can determine whether or not to contribute to the Specification. Since a change in Scope may change the nature of the contribution to the project, a change to a Specification Project’s Scope must be approved by a Super-majority of the Specification Committee.

[[efsp-specifications]]
=== Specifications

Specifications must be developed by Specification Projects. 

A Specification may describe parts as being optional. Optional parts of a Specification must not conflict with one another; it must be possible for a Compatible Implementation to implement all optional parts.

A Specification can define rules. If defined, such rules must not override the rules defined in any referenced Specification.

A Specification that aggregates other Specifications by reference may be designated as a Profile. Profiles do not have to be arranged in unique subsets (i.e. a Specification may appear in more than one Profile). A Super-majority, including a Super-majority of the Strategic Members of the Working Group, is required to approve a Profile Specification. A Specification Committee may, at its discretion, elect to label one or more Profiles as a “Platform”.

[[efsp-versions]]
==== Specification Versions

Each Specification Version references specific versions of its constituent artifacts. These artifacts include the Specification Documents, zero or more other Specifications, one or more Compatible Implementations licensed under an Open Source License, and exactly one associated TCK for this Specification.

.Conceptual structure of a Specification Version
image::images/image3.png[image]

The Specification Document and related technical artifacts must be developed by the Specification Team.

[[efsp-tck]]
==== Technology Compatibility Kits

There is exactly one TCK project under an Open Source License for each Specification Version.

A specific version of a TCK is chosen by the Specification Project for each Specification Version; the TCK may be different for different Specification Versions.

Any implementation that fulfills all of the requirements of the TCK associated with a Final Specification may claim that it is a Compatible Implementation of that Final Specification. The TCK version associated with the Final Specification must not be modified other than as allowed or required by the rules of the TCK.

All parts of a Specification, including optional parts, should be covered by the TCK.

[[efsp-compatible]]
==== Compatible Implementations

A Compatible Implementation must fully implement all non-optional elements of a Specification Version, must not extend the API (no supersetting), and must fulfill all the requirements of the corresponding TCK. A Specification Version must identify at least one Compatible Implementation under an Open Source License that implements all optional elements of the Specification and fulfills the requirements of all elements (including optional elements) of the TCK.

[[efsp-committers]]
=== Committers

Specification Project Committers must be Members of the Eclipse Foundation. Committers may be Members by virtue of working for a member organization, or may choose to complete the membership process independently.

All Specification Project Committers must be covered by a Working Group Participation Agreement.

Member Participants have the right to appoint a Participant Representative to every Specification Project that falls under the purview of the Specification Committee.

[[efsp-committee]]
=== Specification Committee

The Specification Committee works with the PMC to manage the overall vision for the Specification Projects under their supervision.

[[efsp-committee-approvals]]
==== Approvals

A Specification Committee must approve, by Super-majority, the following lifecycle events of Specification Projects:

* The creation of a new Specification Project;
* The Release Plan for a new Release Cycle of a Specification;
* Each revision to the Scope of a Specification;
* Each Review of a Specification Project, including the adoption of Specification Versions;
* A Profile Specification (this Super-majority must include a Super-majority of Strategic Members of the Working Group);
* A Platform designation (this Super-majority must include a Super-majority of Strategic Members of the Working Group); and
* Service Releases.

A ballot is used to seek Specification Committee approval. All Specification Committee ballots must be scheduled to run for a period of no less than one week.

All artifacts related to a ballot must be delivered in distribution form to the Specification Committee prior to the start of the ballot period, must not change during the ballot period (with the exception of minor corrections that do not change the semantic intent, as determined by the Specification Committee), and must persist in the delivered form following the ballot as part of the public record.

[[efsp-plans]]
=== Release Plans

A Release Plan lists themes and areas of focus, describes Milestones, and lists tentative dates for Reviews. The work defined by a Release Plan must be within the Scope of the Specification Project.

The exact requirements for a Release Plan, including the number and timing of Milestones and Reviews, are determined by the Project Leadership Chain and the Specification Committee. Minimally, a Release Plan must include a textual description of the activities planned for the Specification Version, and tentative dates for at least one Milestone, at least one Progress Review, and the Release Review. Following approval, the Specification Committee must be notified of any changes to the dates of the Progress Review and the Release Review. The Specification committee can require that the project team engage in a Progress Review.

The Project Proposal serves as the Release Plan for the first release of a Specification Project.

A Release Plan must be approved by a Super-majority of the Specification Committee. If the Release Plan is rejected, the Specification Team may reapply at a future date.

[[efsp-process]]
== Specification Process

The EFSP is based on the Development Process described in the https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#6_Development_Process[EDP].

[[efsp-project-lifecycle]]
=== Specification Project Lifecycle

The Specification https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#6_2_Project_Lifecycle[Project Lifecycle] is defined by the EDP.

[[efsp-releases]]
==== Releases

While in the Incubation and Mature Phases, a Specification Project may engage in the Release process to produce Specification Versions which, when <<efsp-ratification,Ratified>>, become Final Specifications. <<efsp-reviews,Reviews>> are required for all Releases of a Specification Project.

There are three types of Releases: Major, Minor, and Service. A Specification Team may consult with their PMC and Specification Committee to determine the appropriate classification.

[NOTE]
====
The notions of Major, Minor, and Service Release bear a close resemblance to the "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" structure described by the Semantic Versioning specification. While a Specification Team may opt to use Semantic Versioning when naming their releases, this process imposes no requirement to do so. Further, this process imposes no requirement to tie any particular type of Release to any particular Semantic Versioning scheme.
====

[[efsp-releases-major]]
==== Major and Minor Releases

A Major Release includes significant new features and/or breaking changes. A Minor Release includes new features over a Major Release. For both Major and Minor Releases the Specification Team must engage in at least one successful <<efsp-reviews-progress, Progress Review>> and a successful <<efsp-reviews-release, Release Review>>.

A Specification Project's first Release must be a Major or Minor Release.

[[efsp-milestones]]
==== Milestone Builds

Leading up to a Release, a Specification Team must produce at least one Milestone Build. Milestones and Release Candidates are "almost Releases" intended for adoption and testing by early-adopters. No formal Reviews are required for Milestone Builds. 

Under no circumstances are Milestone Builds to be used as a substitute for doing proper official Releases. 

All communication regarding Milestone Builds must include caveats explaining that these are not official Releases. Milestones and Release Candidate builds must be labeled as such (e.g. `x.yMn`, `x.yRCn`, `alpha`, `beta`, or similar).

[[efsp-releases-service]]
==== Service Releases

A Service Release includes only minor changes and/or clarifications over a Major or Minor Release. Specifically, a Service Release must not include any significant new features and/or breaking changes. A Specification Team may consult with their PMC and Specification Committee to determine precisely what constitutes a minor change and/or clarification.

A Specification Team must have engaged in a successful Release Review for a Major or Minor Release prior to engaging in a Service Release. No Progress Review is required for a Service Release; the Specification Team must, however, engage in a successful <<efsp-reviews-release, Release Review>>.

[[efsp-version-lifecycle]]
=== Specification Version Lifecycle

To produce a Specification Version, a Specification Project must engage in a formal Release Cycle under supervision of the Project Management Committee (PMC) and the Specification Committee.

.The Specification Version Lifecycle at a high-level
[graphviz, images/lifecycle, svg]
.An overview of the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process
----
include::diagrams/efsp_lifecycle.dot[]
----

A Specification Project’s first Release Cycle starts with the successful completion of a Creation Review. To start a subsequent Release Cycle, the Specification Team presents a Release Plan to the Specification Committee in a Plan Review. The Plan Review must be approved by a Super-majority of the Specification Committee.

The Specification Team must deliver at least one Milestone to demonstrate progress and solicit feedback. Milestones may be incomplete. For example, designated Compatible Implementations will not necessarily pass milestone builds of the TCK in their entirety. Subsequent Milestones should, however, demonstrate progress. Later Milestones may be referred to as Release Candidates.

Milestones should be staged for limited distribution to key stakeholders to solicit feedback. The delivery of at least one Milestone must coincide with engagement in a successful Progress Review.

The Specification Team must engage in a successful Release Review before the final Specification Version may be Ratified. A Specification Version becomes a Final Specification when it is Ratified.

[[efsp-reviews]]
=== Reviews

Reviews are a formal process through which all major lifecycle events and changes to Specification Projects are announced and reviewed by the membership-at-large, and approved by the PMC, the Specification Committee, and the EMO.

A Specification Project may engage in all of the Reviews described by the EDP with the additional requirement that approval by a Super-majority of the Specification Committee is required to successfully complete a Review. Such Review shall include affirmation that the Specification Version in progress remains within the Scope of the Specification Project. Other additions and qualifications are noted in the descriptions of the reviews below.

Project Leads are responsible for initiating the appropriate Reviews. The Project Leadership Chain may also initiate a Review on the project’s behalf.

The Specification Team must complete all required due diligence under the Eclipse IP Policy before initiating a Review.

[[efsp-reviews-creation]]
==== Creation Review

Specification Projects are created using the process defined by the EDP with the added requirement that the Specification Committee must approve the Project Proposal by a Super-majority before the Specification Project can successfully complete a Creation Review.

The Specification Committee ballot and the Creation Review run in parallel for a minimum of one week. The Project Proposal text must not be changed during the Creation Review period. If changes are required during this period, the Project Proposal is pushed back into the Proposal Phase.

[[efsp-reviews-plan]]
==== Plan Review

A Plan Review provides a means for the Specification Team to present their Release Plan to the Project Leadership Chain, the Specification Committee, and the community for feedback. The Specification Committee must approve the Plan Review by a Super-majority ballot.

[[efsp-reviews-progress]]
==== Progress Review

A Specification Project must engage in at least one successful Progress Review during every release cycle. The timing of a Progress Review must coincide with the staging of a Milestone which must be delivered to the PMC and the Specification Committee before the start of the Review.

The Specification Committee must approve the Progress Review by a Super-majority.

Progress Reviews may be combined with a Graduation or Restructuring Review, but must not be combined with a Release Review.

[[efsp-reviews-release]]
==== Release Review

A Specification Project must engage in a successful Release Review at the end of each Release Cycle.

The final build of the Specification Version’s artifacts must be delivered to the PMC and Specification Committee before the start of the Release Review. The final build may be staged before the start of the review, but must not be distributed as an official release until the Release Review is successfully completed.

The Specification Team must provide evidence that the TCK selected for the Specification Version provides sufficient coverage to reasonably validate Compatible Implementations.

The Specification Team must provide evidence that cited Compatible Implementations fulfill all requirements of the TCK and that at least one Compatible Implementation implements all optional aspects.

A Release Review concludes successfully with approval from the PMC and EMO, and approval by a Super-majority of the Specification Committee.

With approval, the Specification Project must release the final build of the artifacts of the Specification Version.

[[efsp-ratification]]
=== Ratification

With the approval of the Specification Committee by a Super-majority, a Specification Version is Ratified and the associated artifacts can be promoted and distributed by the Specification Committee as a Final Specification.

All Specification Versions referenced by a Ratified Final Specification must themselves be Ratified. The Release Review for prerequisite Specification Versions may be run concurrently with the Release Review for a referenced Specification Version.

The Specification Document for the Final Specification must be distributed as read-only text under the Eclipse Foundation Specification License. The Ratified TCK in composite must be distributed under the Eclipse Foundation Technology Compatibility Kit License. Other technical artifacts must be distributed under an Open Source License.

The diagram below is a conceptual model of the transition from a Specification Version to a Final Specification. No specific packaging technology or structure should be implied from this diagram.
